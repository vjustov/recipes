# Soft tortillas

Ingredients
* 390 gr | Flour
* 8 grams | Baking powder
* 236.59 ml | Water
* 60 ml | oil
* 5 grams | salt

- Knead

Tips
* Be sure the dough is moist and slightly tacky before kneading. 
* DO NOT Add extra flour while kneading 
* Be sure to knead for 10 to 15 minutes dough should be smooth and soft after kneading 
* Be sure to rest for 15 minutes to allow the gluten in the flour to relax which helps the tortilla to bubble while cooking 
* Try to roll out your tortilla thin 
* Over use of flour during the roll-out process may change the texture
